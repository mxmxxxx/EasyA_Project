# Unmuted
A decentralized video platform where content creators can upload sensitive content without getting censored by Youtube.
### Motivation
A Youtube content creator who makes videos on the lives of war victims are getting their content removed from the platform because the video is too gruelling. However, this prevents the public from accessing the truth, reducing awareness of real issues happening around the globe.
